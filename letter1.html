  <h1>For You, Esther 💖</h1>

  <p style="max-width: 600px; margin: auto; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
    I don’t want to rush love. I want to take my time learning you — the little things,
    like how you take your coffee, and the big things, like what made you cry when you were younger.
    I want to understand why some parts of your past feel heavy to remember.
    <br><br>
    I want to know every version of you — the soft, the messy, the guarded,
    even the parts you find hard to show. Not because I want to change you,
    but because I want to see you completely… and choose you, just the way you are. 💕
